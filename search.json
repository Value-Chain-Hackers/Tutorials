These real-time interactions will show how well your agent responds to commands and conditions based on the system prompts, rules, and parameters you’ve configured.\n\nOpen the center panel in OpenWebUI to begin interacting with your agent.\nIssue a command or input relevant to your test scenario. For example:\n\n\"Optimize the fastest route considering a 20-minute traffic delay on Route A.\"\n\"Respond to the player’s hostile question with a defensive answer.\"\n\nWatch how your agent processes the input and generates a response. Pay close attention to how closely the response aligns with your expectations.\n\nPro Tip: Record the agent’s responses for each scenario. This will help you track its behavior across multiple test sessions.",

Based on the agent’s performance, you’ll need to revisit its configuration and make tweaks to improve its behavior.\n\nRefine System Prompts: If the agent’s response is off-track, consider revising the system prompt to give clearer or more focused instructions.\nModify Parameters: Adjust parameters like temperature, Top K, and frequency penalty to fine-tune the agent’s creativity, response consistency, and overall behavior.\n\nAfter making adjustments, run the tests again to see how the agent’s behavior has improved. Repeat this process as often as necessary to get closer to the desired result.",

This includes checking how well the agent handles real-world data and conditions over extended periods.\n\nAutomated Testing: Consider setting up automated test cases that run at regular intervals to ensure that your agent continues to perform optimally. These tests can track changes in external conditions (such as updates in the logistics network or game dynamics) and help you proactively address any issues.\n\n\n\n6.6.1 Final Thoughts\nTesting your agent is not a one-time task but a continuous process of refinement. By using structured testing methods, adjusting settings through trial and error, and monitoring performance over time, you can create a smarter, more responsive agent. The key to perfection is iteration—fine-tuning the agent until it performs consistently and intelligently in real-world scenarios.",
